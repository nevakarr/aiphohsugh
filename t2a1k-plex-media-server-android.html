Plex is an application that lets you stream your media anywhere, on any device. It comes pre installed for free on SHIELD, making it both a media server and a media player. This means you can enjoy the media currently located on your SHIELD device, stream your media from SHIELD. I paid for the android app and added the media server to my computer. On my first use, I was able to stream a movie from my computer through the plex media player to chromecast and control it with the app on my phone (pause, play, etc). However, I had to move the movie from my tablet to my computer first. My confusion comes from the media server component. Most of my media comes from my tablet or phone. Do I have to move that media to my computer in order to stream it to my chromecast?. 
I just moved to the UK and bought a new Sony with Android TV. My old set up in the US was a 10 year old Samsung, Intel NUC with PMS installed and a Roku. I used to watch Plex and Netflix through the Roku. I could switch HDMI and connect direct to PMS on the NUC. I plan on setting up the NUC and Roku again. How does the setup work with Android TV and the new smart. –ë–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ. Android.

So yeah, I have been running Plex on my computer for about 2 months without any troubles, worked great on my phone. (Android) But now I got a new phone (also Android) and when I logged in, it doesn't show any of my librarys content. I tried googling for the problem but found no results :/ Thanks in advance.

I have what is basically an android tablet running android software version 8.1, Plex will play media off of "web shows" just fine (movie trailers, etc) but when I try and play things off of my media server, it loads for a bit, goes to a black screen, then I am presented with the PLEX loading splash screen as the app reloads. The media shows as "paused" and when I press play I crash back to the android interface. Where do I start to debug. Plex Media Sever is an app that is supported on Android, iOS, PC, MacOS, Roku, Chromecast and more platforms. Plex TV provides you with an undeniably perfect streaming experience. I am a long-time (10+ years) Synology user/customer, and have owned and used multiple Synology NAS devices during this time. I am an advanced consumer ("prosumer") user, using these NAS devices in a home setting, with a relatively high load (both on CPU and transfers). amp#x200B; I do love the DSM OS and its simplicity and stability, and have always appreciated the low noise level and power consumption. I have been very happy to be able to run media 1080p transcoding, a few IP cameras. Hi All, First off apologies if this is the wrong place to post. i figured linux and android were similar enough and there wasnt an android section for the media server I just bought an android tv box off ebay. Nice one, 2.4ghz and 2gb ram my intention was to use it to run all my media. So I'm an HTPC user with Windows 7 and Media Center. Mainly because we still have cable with lots of encrypted channels. One of the reasons I keep this is because I record TONS of TV. So. that being the case I still use OpenPHT. Also just because it's by far the best TV Plex experience. However, starting with 1.15 Plex broke compatibility with OpenPHT so I've stayed on 1.14. However, now with the new mobile client they broke the Home page for anyone on versions older Want a dedicated media server without shelling out the big bucks? Easy, just use your old Android phone or tablet. 
I've been having a lot of problems with Kodi recently (Krypton and Leia) and I thought it might be worth while to look for alternatives. I'm using a RPi3 as my HTPC (might explain a lot of the problems I had) but I simply can't afford to get a proper Media Center PC or NUC. All I need is to stream media from my network storage drive, an online radio app, youtube app, and reddit viewer app. That's all. Anything more is an extra.

When I'm out working and need a playlist of tracks Plex is a powerful application that allows you to enjoy and share your media content with your friends and family. It doesn't matter if you are on a mobile. I want to have a local music server to integrate with HA, but I do not know if there is any option. My idea is to have my server running and some android devices as player to stream music to it. Is it possible? I wanted to use Airsonic server + dsub android app but it seems it is not possible to use with HA. Is there any other option See https://goo.gl/CHv2uD for a list of what's new. Additional: - Configuration could disappear when restarting the device after migrating to external storage. 
why cant there be a roku version of VLC Media Player? Basically an app that has all the codecs that will play ANY media file? If your Plex app is not finding or connecting to your Plex Media Server, please first ensure that: I'm going on a roadtrip and want to use my Go to watch TV but I'm a dumbfuck who doesn't understand sideloading (Do I need an android?Only have an iphone). Is there anyway to just keep shows that are downloaded I have on my laptop on Netflix and watch it from my laptop straight to my Go go gadget goggles.

It's the central, most important piece Another week, another release, and this time a pretty major one! Jellyfin 10.1.0 brings in a lot of reimplementation in the backend, cleanup in the frontend, as well as several broken features made working again. It's mostly for stability/code quality improvements, but there are some feature fixes as well! This is also the first release with the Web frontend split out of the server backend, to better assist in fixing each up without conflict!

I figured since there's USB ports I'll simply use an external HDD, transfer what I want and watch it. Works wonders I gotta say! amp#x200B; Now comes the problem. It's extremely annoying to go behind the TV, unplug the HDD, transfer/delete/modify what needs to be done and then put it back there. Every time I want to transfer something or watch something new.

What do you guys use for managing your library and streaming it locally to other devices ? I tried using Kodi but the interface was plain stupid for the PC and couldn't figure out how to stream my library to my Android phone. I loved the fact that Kodi is open-sourced which mean more customization and more add-ons, I guess so I might head for Plex or Emby but i heard they are not completely free.

I have a desktop that I turned into a self hosted cloud platform using Nextcloud and Ubuntu 18.04 about 8 months ago. I am using it to back up all my files, and it sits in my studio apartment near my bed and I often use it to watch Youtube, netflix, torrented movies, random streams on a web browser, steam/emulated games, and sometimes even just sitting back and browsing the web.
