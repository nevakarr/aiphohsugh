                            <p>Hello everybody, im am currently playing Enigmatica 2 Expert. I played with a friend on Version 1.56 because our Serverhost didnt offer newer Versions and it worked fine. Since we switched our Host and started fresh on Version 1.64d but since then im having issues. When i try loading the game it sometimes works but it usally crashes on the end of step 3. This is the error log im getting: amp#x200B; \---- Minecraft Crash Report ---- \# \# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtim. So I'm about 10 levels into a new game and only recently have I started experiencing frequent crashes, maybe due to an item I hadn't had previously?

Every single time I try to boot up the game to have some fun in the snapshots, it crashes without even opening. I'm not entirely sure what's happening here, but I can provide the crash report if anybody would be able to use it to extrapolate what the problem could be. Seriously. I don't even get the game opening in its window before it tells me it crashed. Here's the crash report I got in case anybody's actually able to interpret its ancient texts and translate it to human/non-programmer langua. 
Just got KaM and was told that their was a remake mod that fixes a lot of the problems the game has; random crashing, AI issues, etc. My problem is that the remake will crash immediately on start up and give me an error code. I've tried going to their forums for advice but I seem to be the only one with this issue and the forums itself has yet to send me a activation email for new account. Figured I try here. Bug log date/time : 2018-12-13, 14:19:37, 986ms computer Hello! My SSD had the same installation for the past 5 years so I reinstalled it using the "Fresh install" option built with windows. It worked great and I've reinstalled most of my apps. I had wow 1.12 on another SSD so the WoW client wasnt touched in the procedure, but now it wont start. I think it's a memory problem, or some kind of access issue accessing the memory? Is there a way to manually set the addon memory or memory used by WoW outside of the game? I've tried everything I can think. The Wine development release 3.13 is now available. ampnbsp; https://www.winehq.org/announce/3.13 ampnbsp; What's new in this release (see below for details): ampnbsp; - Vulkan support on macOS using MoltenVK. - Initial support for performance data in the registry. - Mono engine updated with some bug fixes. - Support for fetching BIOS information on Linux. - GnuTLS also used on macOS when available. - Improvements in the standard Task Dialog.

I was going to download the official release of 1.10 today and upgrade my SMP to it but whenever I try to start 1.10 minecraft I crash immediately upon loading a singleplayer world or connecting to a 1.10 server. Sometimes I get to walk around for a second or two and watch the graphics glitch to hell. I have no mods installed and have tried restarting my computer multiple times, deleting all the contents of the versions folder in .minecraft, and deleting .minecraft entirely. I can't I recently got a new laptop (XPS M1330) and decided to put minecraft on it. When I first downloaded it, it said some problem about open GL, so I fixed that to be able to use it (I forget how I fixed that). When I finally got the game to work, I frequently got 0 FPS, so I tried some methods to boost FPS, but I still got a low number. After having a terrible gameplay, I stopped playing the game for a while. Now, whenever I try to open the game, I get a crash report, can someone help? # # A fatal. So I decided to download a new tree controller. The cascadia tree controller to be exact.I had some issues with brownboxes, so I installed and reinstalled all of the dependencies and it began to work perfectly. I downloaded Lowkee's Flora controllers whatever pack, I can't remember exactly why, and suddenly the tree controller were not working well. Instead of using all of the trees, it only put the same exact trees and a very little amount so it looked quite lame and not as beautiful </p>
